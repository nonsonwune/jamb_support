I had hope that having fulfilled all requirements for CAPS, gaining admission to the choice of my interested course and choice of institution should be seamless but I am getting apprehensive with this longer delay in securing admission considering the fact that time waits for nobody. However I believed in the present reformed of UTME/JAMB CAPS that the system will not fail living to her responsibility as assured. I will appreciate any information to make my dream and interest to study Law in Universities of Abuja flies so as not to put to a waste all effort put in place to attain the best overall students of FGGC Bida 2022/2023 academic session.

How can that be? Catchment cut off is usually lower than Merit cut off.\n\nHow did they arrive at the aggregate of 72. 589 and 70.03 respectively? Using the method I got from students portal I fall within merit group. Even before the school started giving admission they already pasted NO ADMISSION against my name raising my worry and concern. The school is now offering me Physiology which is far from my dream course. I found myself under undue pressure and frustration.\n\nBecause I am under aged and a minor my father complained on my behalf but his complaint was turned down as a third party complaint\n\nI believe that.my jamb score of 287 and NECO result used in post JAMB selection is enough to qualify me for NURSING admission in UNIZIK either on merit or by catchment but if the school denies me my desired course I will leave the matter to God.
