If you don't see any changes within the next week or receive further instructions from your institution, please don't hesitate to reach back out to us. \n\nWe're here to assist you throughout the admission process. \n"

I see that this issue has been ongoing for some time and that you are concerned about potentially losing your admission.\n\nAs per our records and previous responses from my colleagues, OOU has marked your verification status as \"unverified\" on the CAPS platform. We understand that you were present when OOU supposedly sent the verified information, however, for JAMB to proceed,  OOU needs to officially communicate any change in status to us through the proper channels on CAPS. \n\nUnfortunately, JAMB cannot directly engage OOU on your behalf or bypass the established procedures.  \n\nI strongly advise that you immediately contact the Desk Officer at OOU, Mr. Alex, (as you mentioned you have his contact) and explain the urgency of the situation. They are in the best position to rectify any discrepancies or miscommunication regarding your verification status on CAPS.  Please emphasize the approaching deadlines for matriculation. \n\nWe hope this matter gets resolved quickly so you can secure your admission. Please let us know if you have any further questions or require clarification on the CAPS process. \n"

Welcome to JAMB Support Centre,\n\nThank you for contacting us and providing an update on your admission status. \n\nWe understand your frustration with the conflicting information. Let's clarify the Direct Entry admission process:\n\n1. **JAMB's Role:** JAMB conducts the UTME exams (for UTME admission) and processes A'Level results for Direct Entry (DE) candidates. While we verify DE candidates' results, the final admission decision rests with the institution you applied to.\n\n2. **Institution's Role:** Lasustech (formerly Laspotech) reviews the applications of eligible DE candidates (those who meet their cut-off marks and requirements) and publishes the admission list. \n\n**Here's what we'll do:**\n\n* **Verify Your A'Level Result Status:** We will double-check the verification status of your A'Level result on our end and ensure it's marked as verified for Lasustech's access. \n* **Liaise with Lasustech:**  We will contact the Admissions Office at Lasustech to inquire about your application status and the reason your name isn't on the admission list, considering your OND institution has confirmed the verification. \n\nWe kindly request your patience as we work towards resolving this. We will get back to you within [Specify a reasonable timeframe, e.g., 48 hours] with an update. \n\nYou can also reach out to Lasustech's Admissions Office directly at [Provide phone number or email address if available] for further clarification.\n\nThank you for your understanding. \n\nSincerely,\nNonso nwune\nJAMB Support Centre \n"

Welcome to JAMB Support Centre,\n\nI understand you're concerned about your admission status on JAMB CAPS not reflecting the admission offered to you by LASUED on January 26th, 2024. I also see that you've encountered issues with your A'level verification on NIPED and accessing your CAPS icon. \n\nIt's important to address each of these concerns separately:\n\n**1. LASUED Admission Not Reflecting on JAMB CAPS:**\n\n* While you've received admission from LASUED, they need to upload their list of admitted students on JAMB CAPS for it to reflect on your profile. \n* Please reach out to LASUED's admissions office immediately and confirm if they have uploaded their admission list on JAMB CAPS. \n*  Provide them with your JAMB registration number and other relevant details to assist them in verifying your admission.\n\n**2. NIPED A'level Verification Issue:**\n\n*  Fluctuations in verification status can occur on NIPED. It's important to remain patient and continue monitoring the status. \n* Ensure that the details you provided during the verification process are accurate.\n* If the issue persists, you may need to contact NIPED directly for further assistance.\n\n**3. CAPS Icon Not Responding:**\n\n*  Technical glitches on the JAMB portal can occur occasionally. \n* Try clearing your browser cache and cookies or using a different browser or device.\n* Ensure you have a stable internet connection.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* **Contact LASUED:**  Your priority is to confirm with LASUED if they've uploaded their admission list on JAMB CAPS.  \n* **Monitor NIPED:** Keep checking the status of your A'Level verification on NIPED. \n* **JAMB Support:**  If the issues with CAPS access persist, you may need to contact JAMB's support team directly for technical assistance.\n\nPlease remain patient and persistent in following up with the relevant parties. I trust these issues will be resolved soon.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNonso Nwune\nJAMB Support  \n"

Welcome to JAMB Support Centre.\n\nI understand you are facing difficulties accessing your CAPS to accept your admission offer from Olabisi Onabanjo University and the deadline for school fees payment is fast approaching. I know this can be frustrating, and I will do my best to help you. \n\nIt seems your O'Level results have been uploaded, which is a good step. However, your admission on CAPS still shows as \"in progress.\"  \n\nSince the deadline for your school fees is approaching quickly, I recommend contacting Olabisi Onabanjo University's admissions department directly. They can provide further information on the status of your admission on CAPS and advise you on the steps needed to obtain your JAMB admission letter. \n\nPlease provide them with your JAMB registration number and other relevant details. They are usually in the best position to expedite the process with JAMB.\n\nWe understand the urgency of the situation, and we wish you the best in resolving this issue promptly. \n"

I understand you're concerned that your CAPS hasn't changed despite scoring above the cut-off mark.\n\nFirstly, congratulations on meeting the cut-off! It's important to remember that meeting the cut-off doesn't automatically guarantee admission.  Admission processes vary between institutions and often involve additional factors like:\n\n* **Post-UTME/Screening:** Did AAU conduct a Post-UTME exam or screening exercise? Your performance in these might be a determining factor. \n* **Admission Quotas:** Each department has a limited number of students they can admit. Your chosen course might be more competitive.\n* **O'Level Results:**  Universities often consider the grades obtained in relevant O'Level subjects.\n* **Availability of Space:** Admission is also contingent on the availability of space within your chosen course.\n\n**Here's what I recommend:**\n\n1. **Check the AAU Admission Portal:** Visit the official Adekunle Ajasin University admission portal regularly for updates.\n2. **Contact AAU Directly:** Reach out to the AAU admissions office via their official phone numbers or email addresses listed on their website. They are in the best position to provide specific information about your application. \n\nPlease note that JAMB Support Centre facilitates the UTME exams and general admission processes, but specific admission decisions are handled by the individual institutions. \n\nI hope this information is helpful. Feel free to reach back out if you have any further questions. \n\nSincerely,\n\nNonso nwune\nJAMB Support Centre \n"

Welcome to JAMB Support Centre, \n\nI understand your concern about your admission status still showing as \"Admission in Progress\" on the JAMB portal for three months now.  \n\nWhile seeing \"Admission in Progress\" on the JAMB portal is a positive sign indicating you've been processed for admission consideration, it's important to remember that UNILAG makes the final admission decision. \n\nIt's not uncommon for institutions to have varying timelines for releasing admission lists. I recommend you remain patient and continue checking both your JAMB CAPS portal and the UNILAG admissions portal for updates.  \n\nShould you require further clarification, it's always best to reach out to UNILAG admissions office directly. They will have the most up-to-date information regarding your specific application. \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding. \n"

Welcome to JAMB Support Centre.\n\nI understand your concern about your admission status to Abia State University (ABSU) for the 2023/2024 academic session and your desire to study Nursing. It's understandable to feel anxious when seeing others who may have scored lower than you getting admitted. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that admission decisions are made by the institutions themselves, based on various factors, including their specific departmental requirements, quota system, and the number of applicants. While your JAMB and screening scores are strong indicators, they don't automatically guarantee admission. \n\nRegarding the email you received about a possible transfer to another course, it's crucial to clarify directly with ABSU if that is indeed their final decision and understand the reasoning behind it.  \n\nAs for your 2024 Mock result, kindly create a separate ticket specifically addressing this issue for better tracking and resolution. This will allow us to assist you more efficiently.\n\nHere are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Contact ABSU Admissions Directly:** Reach out to their admissions office via phone or email for a clearer update on your application status and to express your strong preference for Nursing. \n2. **Explore Available Options:**  If ABSU's decision is final and you're not offered admission into Nursing, discuss any alternative options they might have available. \n3. **Consider Other Institutions (If Necessary):**  If your heart is set on studying Nursing and ABSU doesn't work out, explore other reputable institutions that offer your desired program.\n\nRemember that the admission process takes time, and it's crucial to remain patient and persistent. \n\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions or concerns. \n"

Admission for DE candidates is usually based on their qualifications such as A-Levels, OND, HND, or equivalent. \n\nHowever, I strongly advise you to regularly check the official JAMB website and publications for the most up-to-date information on the 2024 DE admission process. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions. \n"

Welcome to JAMB Support Centre.\n\nI understand you're concerned about the discrepancies between the information on your JAMB profile and your school's portal, especially regarding your date of birth and its potential impact on your admission.\n\nWhile having different dates of birth on your JAMB profile and your school's records can pose a problem during admission, it's important to address this issue directly with your institution. They have their own internal processes for verifying student information.\n\nHere’s what I recommend:\n1. **Contact your institution's admissions office immediately.**  Explain the discrepancy and inquire about their specific procedure for rectifying it. \n2. **Gather supporting documentation.** This may include your birth certificate, JAMB registration slip, and any other relevant documents that can verify your correct date of birth.\n3. **Follow their instructions carefully.**  Your institution will guide you on the necessary steps to align your information and ensure a smooth admission process.\n\nPlease note that JAMB Support cannot directly modify information on your school's portal. We are here to assist you with the JAMB-related aspects of your application. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or concerns regarding your JAMB profile. \n"

Welcome to JAMB Support Centre, \n\nI understand you're unable to print your admission letter because your JAMB profile still reflects Auchi Polytechnic instead of Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, even after completing the regularization process.  \n\nI can see that you've been in contact with us for a while regarding this issue, and I apologize for the delay and any frustration it may have caused. \n\nIt appears your indemnity form hasn't been fully processed and uploaded to the JAMB headquarters. To expedite this process, please visit your institution, Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka, and request them to:\n\n1. **Confirm the status of your indemnity form.**\n2. **Forward your indemnity form to the JAMB state office in Anambra for uploading to the headquarters if it hasn't been done already.** \n\nOnce the JAMB headquarters receives and approves your indemnity form, your details will be updated, and you'll be able to print your admission letter. \n\nPlease let us know if you require further assistance or have any additional questions. \n"
