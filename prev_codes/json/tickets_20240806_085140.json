Welcome to JAMB Support Centre, \n\nThank you for contacting us regarding the discrepancy between the name on your JAMB profile and your other official documents. We understand this is a frustrating situation, and we're here to help.\n\nTo rectify the name difference on your JAMB profile and potentially facilitate the release of your admission letter, you'll need to initiate a formal name correction process with JAMB.  Here’s what you can do: \n\n1. **Gather your Documents:** Prepare clear scanned copies of your NIN slip, WAEC certificate, and JUPEB result showing the correct name, Edoso Favour Moyinoluwa. \n2. **Visit a JAMB Office:**  You'll need to personally visit any JAMB office nationwide and submit an application for a change of name.  Be sure to bring along the original copies of the documents mentioned above for verification.\n3. **Pay a Fee:** There is usually a nominal fee associated with name correction applications. The JAMB officials at the office will guide you accordingly. \n\nOnce you’ve submitted your application, JAMB will review your case and, if approved, update your name on the portal. This process usually takes a few weeks, but it's essential to ensure accuracy for your admission process.\n\nWe understand you are eager to receive your admission letter. Rest assured; once the name correction is reflected on your JAMB profile, your admission will be processed accordingly, assuming you meet all other requirements. \n\nFor further assistance and guidance on the name change application, you can also reach out to JAMB directly through their official channels:\n\n* **JAMB Website:** [Insert official JAMB website address here] \n* **JAMB Support Phone Number:** [Insert official JAMB phone number here]\n\nWe hope this information is helpful. Please let us know if you have any further questions or require additional assistance. \n"

This is a common step in the Direct Entry admission process. \n\nWhile this process can sometimes take a while, be assured that JAMB is working with your institution to finalize your admission status. \n\nHere's what we recommend: \n\n1. **Contact the University of Port Harcourt Admissions Office:** They are best positioned to provide you with a more specific timeline and confirm if they require any further documentation from you. \n2. **Continue to monitor your CAPS:**  JAMB regularly updates the system, so keep checking for any changes. \n\nWe appreciate your patience and understanding. \n\nSincerely, \nNonso Nwune\nJAMB Support \n"

I understand your concern about not being able to print your admission letter and register, especially since the semester has already commenced.\n\nWhile JAMB handles the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), each university manages its individual admissions processes.  This means that even after a successful departmental screening,  Bauchi State University Gadau is responsible for finalizing and releasing your admission letter. \n\nI recommend taking the following steps:\n\n1. **Contact the Bauchi State University Gadau Admissions Office directly.** They are best equipped to provide you with specific details about your admission status and any potential delays. \n2. **Provide them with your JAMB registration number and other relevant details** when contacting them to expedite the process.\n\nI understand this situation can be frustrating. Please know that contacting the university directly is the most effective way to resolve this issue promptly. \n\nWe wish you the best with your admission and studies. \n"

It seems you've been diligently following up and are facing a difficult situation.\n\nFrom your messages, it appears you were initially offered a transfer from Nursing Science to Radiography at the University of Lagos while on AIP. You have accepted the transfer. \n\nTo clarify, accepting the transfer alone does not automatically change your admission status. You still need to apply for a Change of Course through the JAMB portal to reflect Radiography as your desired program.\n\nWhile the delay is regrettable, unfortunately, JAMB doesn't directly control the University's admission process. They have their own internal procedures. \n\nHowever, I can try to escalate this to the relevant department within JAMB and inquire about the status of your Change of Course application. Please confirm if you have submitted this application already.\n\nAdditionally, I highly recommend reaching out to the University of Lagos admissions office again, explaining your situation, and seeking further guidance from their end. They might have specific instructions or a timeline for students in your situation.\n\nRest assured, I will do my best to assist you and provide updates as they become available. \n"

Explain your situation and inquire about their internal procedures for handling such cases. They might have alternative methods of receiving and verifying results.\n2. **Formal Complaint with JAMB:** While I cannot guarantee a change in the system, consider submitting a formal complaint letter to the JAMB headquarters.  Detail the situation, including the date you visited the JAMB state office and the information you received. This creates a formal record of your complaint.\n\nPlease note that JAMB policies and deadlines are subject to change. \n\nI hope this information helps, and I wish you the best in resolving this issue. \n"

Welcome to JAMB Support Centre.\n\nI understand you're concerned about your admission status on JAMB CAPS not reflecting the admission you received from LASUED on January 26th. You also mentioned issues with your A'level verification status on NIPED and the CAPS icon not responding. \n\nWhile LASUED handles its admission process, your JAMB CAPS profile needs to reflect this for your admission to be considered complete. It's important to address these issues promptly.\n\nHere's what I can suggest:\n\n1. **Contact LASUED Admissions:**  Inform them that your JAMB CAPS status hasn't been updated. They might need to upload a list of admitted students to JAMB, which will trigger the update on your CAPS profile.\n2. **NIPED Verification:** Since your A'level verification status keeps changing, it's best to reach out to NIPED directly. They can guide you on the correct process and address any potential issues with your verification.\n3. **CAPS Technical Issues:** For the unresponsive CAPS icon, try these troubleshooting steps:\n    * Clear your browser's cache and cookies.\n    * Try accessing CAPS using a different browser or device.\n    * Ensure you're using a stable internet connection. \n    \nIf these issues persist, you might need to visit a JAMB office or contact their support directly for further technical assistance. \n\nPlease keep me updated on the outcome of these steps. I'm here to assist you in any way I can to resolve this. \n"

Welcome to JAMB Support Centre, \n\nI understand you are experiencing issues with your admission status despite scoring above the cut-off mark. I also see that you're having trouble accessing your JAMB PIN after a successful purchase. \n\nTo help me look into these separate issues for you, could you please confirm which institution you're seeking admission to? \n\nRegarding your JAMB PIN, I'll need to verify some details to assist you better. Can you please provide the following information:\n\n* **Transaction ID:**  This is usually found in the confirmation email or SMS you received after your successful payment. \n* **Date of Payment:**  Providing the date will help us locate your transaction faster.\n* **Payment Method:** Let us know if you used a debit card, bank transfer, or another method.\n\nOnce you provide these details, I'll do my best to resolve your JAMB PIN issue promptly. \n\nRegarding your admission status, while we handle JAMB PIN issues, it's best to contact the admission office of the institution you applied to. They are in the best position to provide information on their specific admission processes and timelines. \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding. \n"

Reach out to their admissions office through their official channels for the most up-to-date information. \n2. **Regularly Check Both Portals:** Continue monitoring both your JAMB CAPS portal and the UNILAG admissions portal for any changes.\n3. **Stay Informed:** Keep yourself updated on any announcements or deadlines communicated by both JAMB and UNILAG.\n\nPlease be patient as the admission process unfolds. \n\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to ask. \n"

The admission should be reflected there soon.\n3. **Contact JAMB if Necessary:** If, after a reasonable time, your admission status is not updated on JAMB CAPS, you can contact JAMB directly through their official channels for further assistance.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else we can assist you with.\n"

We'll do our best to provide you with an update as soon as possible.\n\nIn the meantime, I recommend continuing to check your CAPS profile regularly for any changes. \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding. \n"

Welcome to JAMB Support Centre.\n\nI understand your concerns about your admission status and the recent email you received. It appears you've been offered an alternative course while you prefer Nursing.  It's also concerning to hear that you are unable to access your 2024 Mock results.\n\nLet's address these one at a time:\n\n**Regarding the admission:**\n\n* **Course Change:** While JAMB facilitates the admission process, the final decision on admissions and course placements lies with the institutions. It is possible ABSU offered you an alternative course based on factors like the number of applicants, available slots, and your qualifications for each program.\n* **Next Steps:**  I strongly advise you to contact ABSU's admissions office directly. Explain your situation and inquire about the possibility of switching to Nursing. They would be the best source of information regarding available options. \n\n**Regarding your Mock Results:**\n\n* **Technical Issues?:**  There might be temporary technical issues affecting the JAMB portal. Try accessing your results again later. \n* **Contact JAMB:** If the issue persists, reach out to our dedicated support channel specifically for result-related inquiries. This information can often be found on the JAMB website or your JAMB portal. \n\nPlease note: Ensure you have your JAMB registration number, phone number, and email address readily available when contacting both ABSU and JAMB. \n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you the best in securing your desired admission. \n"

How can that be? Catchment cut off is usually lower than Merit cut off.\n\nHow did they arrive at the aggregate of 72. 589 and 70.03 respectively?

This will display your official JAMB and O'level results as recorded by JAMB, and the aggregate score calculated by the system.\n\n2. **UNIZIK Portal Screenshot:** Similarly, could you provide a screenshot of your application status on the UNIZIK admission portal?\n\nOnce we have this information, we can:\n\n* **Verify Aggregate Score:** We will double-check the calculation of your aggregate score based on JAMB's weighting system for your chosen course (Nursing Sciences).\n* **Clarify Cut-off Marks:** We'll contact UNIZIK's admissions department to get accurate information regarding the merit and catchment cut-off marks for Nursing Sciences for the 2023/2024 academic session.\n* **Investigate Discrepancies:** If there are any inconsistencies between your calculated score and the university's records, we will work with UNIZIK to investigate and rectify the issue.\n\nPlease understand that while we are committed to advocating for students and ensuring fairness in the admission process, final admission decisions rest with the respective universities.  \n\nWe await the requested information so we can assist you further. \n"

It's essential to ensure there are no errors or omissions from their side.\n\n2. **JAMB Portal Monitoring:** Continue checking your JAMB CAPS portal regularly for updates. JAMB will typically send notifications once your regularization window is open.\n\n3. **Direct JAMB Contact (If necessary):** If you haven't received any updates within the next week, you can reach out to JAMB directly through their official channels for further assistance. They might be able to provide more specific information regarding your application's status. \n\nWe understand this situation can be frustrating, and we appreciate your patience as we work towards resolving this. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions. \n"

Welcome to JAMB Support Centre.\n\nI understand you're inquiring about whether DE (Direct Entry) candidates will be required to take the UTME exam for the 2024/2025 admission cycle. \n\nWhile the specific requirements for the 2024/2025 admission session are yet to be officially announced, typically, DE candidates are not required to sit for the UTME exam. \n\nDirect Entry admissions are based on qualifications like A-Level results or a recognized Diploma certificate. I recommend checking the official JAMB website or the admission portal of your prospective institution for the most up-to-date information on DE admission requirements as they become available. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions. \n"

Welcome to JAMB Support Centre, \n\nI understand you're concerned about the discrepancies between the information on your JAMB profile and your school portal, particularly your date of birth and how it might affect your admission.  \n\nRegarding your date of birth, it is crucial that the information on your JAMB profile matches the information on your school's portal.  A discrepancy could potentially lead to complications with your admission.  You mentioned applying for a DOB correction at a JAMB office - this was the right step to take. To follow up on your application status, I recommend visiting the JAMB office where you submitted your application for a status update.\n\nWhile the email address on your JAMB profile cannot be changed, it shouldn’t affect your admission if it differs from the one on your school portal. What is most important is that your other vital information, especially your name and date of birth, match on both platforms.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions. \n"

It appears there's some confusion stemming from a previous UTME-to-DE conversion and a possible name error in your CUIIA congratulatory message. \n\nLet's address these one at a time:\n\n**Regarding your sister's DE conversion:** \n\nAs previously explained, the UTME-to-DE conversion is irreversible. Unfortunately, this means she can't use her UTME scores for admission anymore. Her best course of action is to explore options for the DE program at her chosen institution. \n\n**Regarding your name in the CUIIA message:**\n\nIt's great that you received your admission message! Congratulations! However, I understand the concern about the typo in your name. \n\nWhile your school mentioned the correction has been made, I strongly recommend reaching out to CUIIA's admissions department directly to confirm this. Having consistent records across all platforms is crucial to prevent issues later. \n\n**JAMB Regularization:**\n\nDon't delay your JAMB regularization process. It's crucial to align your admission with JAMB records regardless of the minor name discrepancy. You can proceed with regularization while confirming the name change with CUIIA.\n\nIf you encounter any problems during regularization specifically due to the name typo, please don't hesitate to contact us again with specific details of the issue. \n\nWe're here to assist you in navigating these processes. \n\nBest regards,\n\nNonso Nwune\nJAMB Support Centre \n"

I can see that this has been an ongoing issue since September, and I apologize for the delay and frustration this has caused.\n\nIt appears your indemnity form might not have been properly processed at either the JAMB state office in Anambra or the JAMB headquarters. \n\nTo resolve this, please confirm the following with your institution (Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka):\n\n1. **Submission Confirmation:** Ensure they have physically submitted your indemnity form to the JAMB state office in Anambra. \n2. **Follow Up:** Request that the institution follows up with the JAMB state office to confirm if the form has been uploaded to the JAMB headquarters for final approval.\n\nOnce these steps are confirmed, please inform me of the outcome so we can further assist you in getting your admission letter printed. \n\nRegarding your question about thumbprinting in Lagos, I need to check with my supervisor about the process for out-of-state thumbprinting. Please allow me some time to get back to you with that information.\n\nWe appreciate your patience. \n"

Welcome to JAMB Support Centre,\n\nI understand your frustration with the admission process and the delay you've experienced. I see that your CAPS still shows \"Admission in Progress\" and that you've been waiting for a resolution for several months. Rest assured that I'm here to help.\n\nWhile I can't directly approve your admission or speed up the verification process from our end, I can offer some advice. It's good that you've already uploaded all the necessary documents, including your A'level result.\n\nHere's what I suggest: \n\n1. **Direct Contact:** Since your admission should have been processed by now, I recommend reaching out directly to JAMB via their official phone lines or by visiting a JAMB office in person if possible. They might be able to provide more specific guidance on your particular case and expedite the process. You can find their contact information on the official JAMB website.\n2. **Contact Your Institution:** It's also a good idea to contact the admissions office of your chosen institution. They can check their records and confirm if there are any outstanding requirements or issues from their side that might be causing the delay.\n\nPlease note that JAMB handles a high volume of applications, which can sometimes lead to delays. However, by being proactive and reaching out directly to the relevant parties, you increase your chances of a quicker resolution.\n\nI hope this information helps, and I wish you the best of luck with your admission process. \n\nSincerely, \n\nNonso Nwune\nJAMB Support Agent \n"
